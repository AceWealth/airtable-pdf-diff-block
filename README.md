# airtable-pdf-diff-block

PDF Diff is an Airtable Block that helps you find differences in text between any two PDF Documents. This is powered by [pdf-diff](https://github.com/JoshData/pdf-diff) library.

You would need to host an instance of https://github.com/ashwanthkumar/pdf-diff-service and configure that in the block settings.
